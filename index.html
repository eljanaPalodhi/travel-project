            <h3>
              Zürich, the city with the highest quality of life worldwide.
            </h3>
            <p>
              The city is located in the eastern part of Switzerland , on the
              Limmat at the outflow of Lake Zurich . Its inhabitants are called
              Zürcher (or Stadtzürcher to differentiate them from the other
              inhabitants of the canton).
            </p>
            <p>
              Zurich, which emerged from the Roman base of Turicum , became a
              free imperial city in 1262 and a member of the Swiss Confederation
              in 1351 . The city of the reformer Huldrych Zwingli became the
              second most important (after Wittenberg ) center of the
              Reformation in 1519 . To this day it is considered the starting
              point of the worldwide Reformed Church and the Anabaptists . In
              the industrial age , the city experienced its rise to become
              today's economic metropolis of Switzerland.
